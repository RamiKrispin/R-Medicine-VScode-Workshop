title: "Using Environment Variables"
---

This section focuses on setting environment variables during the image's run time.

Environment variable are a great tool to make your code dynamic and flexiable. Setting environment variable during the run time enables to pass useful information to the container, such as passwords and credentials or any other information. For example, let's add to the `r-base` image an environment variable named `MY_VAR` with the value of `MY_VALUE`:

```shell
docker run --interactive --tty \
 -e MY_VAR="MY_VALUE" \
 -v ~/Personal/tutorials/r-medicine-vscode-workshop/scripts/:/scripts \
 -v ~/Personal/tutorials/r-medicine-vscode-workshop/data/:/data \
 rocker/r-base
```
As before, this will open an R session, and we can use the `Sys.getenv` function to print the variable value:

```shell
 WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested
